I have an idea for where I want to go with this project.  Right now I am struggling to come up with the independent technology to use for it.  I hope that in the next week or so, when I flesh out the project more, I will have a better idea of what that independent technology could be.  

I am also concerned that I will making too major decisions concerning the project within the next two weeks.  Perhaps, it wold be better to space out the necessary items a little bit more in the project plan.

One unexpected issue I came across this week dealt with the orientation of pictures I was uploading for my screen design.  When uploaded, some of them displayed upside down.  After a little Googling, it turns out that I had to open each one and resave it.  After uploading the photos again the orientation was correct.  It was an amusing and annoying little bug.

I struggled for a long time to come up with an ExtraCurricular Activity that interests me for the first presentation.  My decision was partially hampered by having class on Monday and Wednesday nights, which limits my meetup options.  I finally decided on giving a presentation comparing Java and Scala.  I interested in discovering what I find.  I believe it will also be challenging fitting everything in 10-20 minutes.  Especially with Scala going to be a completely new discovery to the majority of my audience(myself included!).

I had to push some things back in my Project Plan.  I hit upon quite a number of problems trying to complete the exercises for week 2.  I ran into one of those bugs where the file got corrupted somehow and IntelliJ kept discovered bad characters that prevented me from running anything.  I resolved that by deleting the entire contents of the file and retyping everything.

The second issue I had with the exercises was trying determine the difference between a negative test and an exception test.  I got deep in the weeds on this one and still don't know if there is one.

### Week 3

I am either not that great at planning or looking ahead, as I needed to make another change to my Project Plan.  With the Hibernate implementation exercise due next week, I figure I might as well move the database stuff up to this week.
