# Jesse McGil Allen Individual Project

### Problem Statement
While completing the MATC program, I have been introduced to several different languages and technologies.  I have also never seemed to have a strong preference towards a particular language. I would like to be able to easily compare different languages solution to the same programming problem. Weel-known problems such as FizzBuzz, Towers of Hanoi, and possibly interpretations of various computer science concepts.  Therefore, I would like to create a website that aggregates different language solutions to various programming problems for comparison.
