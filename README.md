### Problem Statement
I have been having trouble finding a job.  One area I seem to particularly struggle in is the technical interview.  Part of the reason I believe I struggle at technical interviews is that I can't keep the similar elements of different languages straight.  For instance, I can't keep track of which languages use length, size, or count to get the size of an Array.  I would like to build a website that helps me prepare for job interviews.  It would have sections devoted to language-specific concepts and other sections devoted to comparing languages.
